# Productivity Hub
This is one of my emerging projects to utilize Claude Code (and potentially OpenCode, Aider and other suitable tools
with Claude Code being a priority) to manage my productivity.

* Supporting me in staying on top of things: Manage daily and weekly planning, reviews, wrap ups and getting shit done.
* Supporting me in learning new stuff: manage my learning backlong and active learning projects, 
  sifting through my subscribed newsletters, YouTube videos and Learning Backlog: summarizing, cross-referencing,
  creating flashcards, running researches and searches.
* Supporting me in staying in shape physically, mentally and emotionally: engaging me in reflection and gratitude
  journaling, helping me to improve my workflow and learning new habbits.

To achieve all this, Claude Code will be heavily customized with sub-agents, slash commands and most importantly:
MCP servers.

The purpose of this repo is to develop robust configuration for Claude Code, suitable integrations (MCP servers, APIs,
tools) taking advantage of what's already out there (open source utilities, Cloud services, etc.) and developing
suitable alternatives if needed.

This repository is hosted in GitHub. We will use GitHub issues to manage work on this repository.
